# A-Search-Engine
building a search engine by combining semantics search and elastic search this search engine will be able to take user data and then return the answer of the question for example : - 
a user searching for an software engineer in New Delhi than this search engine must give the most relevant results by taking minimum time 


Semantic search denotes search with meaning, as distinguished from lexical search where the search engine looks for literal matches of the query words or variants of them, without understanding the overall meaning of the query
